  <h2>Artifacts:</h2>
  <p>Ark has artifacts in the game which you can turn into the obelisks for different sorts of rewards, for example they will sometimes give you better armour blueprints, or better weapon blueprints (as you can tell now, you get all of the better items using blueprints) or even better dino saddles, these better items will give you better protection from the elements, protection from agressive dinos and the weapons will be able to output more damage</p>
